# Why PulseStack Exists

Modern AI systems are no longer single prompts.

They are:
- multi-agent workflows
- distributed automation pipelines
- tool-calling runtimes
- event-driven orchestrators
- long-running autonomous systems

But current observability tooling was built for:
- REST APIs
- microservices
- traditional backend systems

Not for:
- LLM execution chains
- agent memory flows
- workflow DAGs
- deterministic replay
- token-level tracing
- AI runtime debugging

## The Problem

When AI workflows fail in production, teams struggle to answer:

- Which agent step failed?
- What event triggered the cascade?
- Which tool call caused latency spikes?
- Why did the workflow produce inconsistent outputs?
- How do we replay executions deterministically?
- Which tenant or workflow version caused regressions?
- Where are tokens, retries, and costs being consumed?

Traditional monitoring tools cannot fully reconstruct AI-native execution flows.

# What PulseStack Solves

PulseStack provides a complete runtime intelligence layer for AI systems.

It enables teams to:

- trace distributed AI workflows in real time
- monitor agent execution pipelines
- replay workflow runs deterministically
- inspect DAG execution graphs
- stream runtime telemetry
- analyze workflow bottlenecks
- correlate events across services
- observe multi-agent systems at scale
